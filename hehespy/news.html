        <p class="news-content"><em>edit: this was all made by one person so if it is bad then sorry ðŸ¤£</em></p>
        <p class="news-content">edit again: <strong>âš âš  Not all services are working yet, and I'm the only one working on this so you will have to use another open-source gamespy server for all besides the GPCM and GPSP server until I possibly find out how to make those servers âš âš </strong></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="news-content">probably messy but eh I just want to make a service that works<div class="divider">**(even partially)**</div></p>
        <p class="news-content"><strong>I am no professional so some things will seem a bit off but it works for logging in and some things,</strong></p>
        <p class="news-content"><strong>Still trying to figure out the buddy system and saving and sending buddy lists, maybe use MySQL or something else? ðŸ¤”</strong></p>
        <p class="news-content">This project uses REDIS to save accounts and etc <strong>(more to come)</strong></p>
        <p class="news-content">Accounts can be banned by setting <strong>**banned** from 0 (unbanned) to 1 (banned)</strong></p>
        <p class="news-content">Yes, even that exe is required to run in the same directory as the HeHeSPY.py file to decode passwords sent from the clients <strong>**for now**</strong></p>
        <p class="news-content">If GPSP is going to be on a different server, it will need a copy of the HeHeSPY.py file with it so it can use some things from it, but better to just have it all in one place for compatibility, and I haven't tested them separated so one server is recommended.</p>
